# Migration Status: Supabase → Netlify Functions

## ✅ **Completed**
- ✅ Removed Express.js server files
- ✅ Created Netlify Functions for authentication
- ✅ Built Netlify-compatible auth client (`/src/lib/netlify-auth.ts`)  
- ✅ Updated `useAuth.ts` composable to use new auth system
- ✅ Created MongoDB-compatible type definitions
- ✅ Removed all Supabase imports from files

## ⚠️ **Compilation Errors (35+ errors)**

### **Field Name Mismatches:**
- Old: `id` → New: `_id` (MongoDB uses _id)
- Old: `produce_type_id` → New: `produceTypeId` (camelCase)
- Old: `contact_info` → New: `contactInfo` (camelCase)  
- Old: `commitment_amounts` → New: `commitmentAmounts` (camelCase)

### **Missing Implementations:**
- Store functions still reference `supabase` object
- Dashboard store needs complete rewrite
- Admin store CRUD operations not implemented
- Excel export utility needs type updates

### **Files with Errors:**
- `src/components/admin/*.vue` - Field name mismatches
- `src/stores/admin.ts` - Missing supabase object, field names
- `src/stores/dashboard.ts` - Complete rewrite needed
- `src/utils/excelExport.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/views/*.vue` - Field name updates needed

## 🎯 **Next Steps (Recommended Order)**

### **Phase 1: Get Auth Working (High Priority)**
1. **Test Authentication Flow**
   ```bash
   netlify dev  # Start local development
   # Visit localhost:8888
   # Test sign in with admin@gardenforall.org / admin123
   ```

2. **Fix Critical Auth Issues** (if any)

### **Phase 2: Fix Compilation Errors**
1. Update field names in all Vue components (`id` → `_id`, etc.)
2. Complete store implementations with placeholder functions
3. Fix type definitions in utilities

### **Phase 3: Implement Data Functions** 
1. Create Netlify Functions for harvest CRUD
2. Create Netlify Functions for admin CRUD  
3. Create Netlify Functions for dashboard data
4. Update stores to use real API calls

## 🔧 **Quick Fix for Development**

To get the app running immediately without compilation errors:

```typescript
// Add this to any file with errors as temporary fix
declare global {
  const supabase: any
  const Database: any
}
```

## 🚦 **Current Status**

**Authentication**: ✅ Ready to test  
**Data Operations**: ❌ Placeholder functions only  
**Compilation**: ❌ 35+ TypeScript errors  
**Frontend**: ⚠️ Will load but data operations won't work  

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**Focus on authentication first!** The auth system is complete and ready to test. Once that's working, we can systematically fix the data operations.

Would you like me to:
1. **Test the authentication flow** (recommended)
2. **Fix all compilation errors** (time-intensive) 
3. **Create data operation functions** (after auth is confirmed working)

The auth system is the foundation - let's make sure that works before building on top of it!
